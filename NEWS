* Changes in emacs-from-source 1.1.1

** Added a sub-command `revert'

`make-current' will not only create a new symlink, but will link to
the last "current" build. `emacs-from-source revert' will symlink to
the last "current" build & create a new link "bad" pointing to the
previous "current" build.


* Changes in emacs-from-source 1.0.1

** Improved error handling

Assorted changes throughout to catch & report on more errors. Also
fixed a few copy-n-paste errors in help messages.

** Update to buld on Emacs Mojave
Apple changed the location of libxml2.

** Bugfix
`install_emacs' would exit with status one even on successful
install-- fixed.

** Re-wrote the logic for branch & tag handling
The previous logic for updating to a branch just didn't work; that has
been fixed.

The previous scheme didn't tag the install directory with the git
commit from which it had been built, making upgrading difficult.

** Added a new sub-command `make-current'
Pursuant to the above, the program now manages a symlink in the
install directory named "current", `emacs-from-source make-current'
will change that symlink to point to different versions of Emacs.
